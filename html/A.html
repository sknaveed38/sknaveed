                (pl.: <b>gymnasiums</b> or <b>gymnasia</b>), is an indoor venue for exercise and sports. The word is

            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Old Indian gyms, known as Akhadas, were traditional training centers where wrestlers, or Pehlwans,
                practiced
                physical fitness and martial arts. Unlike modern gyms, these Akhadas focused on functional strength,
                endurance,
                and discipline rather than just muscle building. Training took place in mud wrestling pits, which
                provided a
                natural and safer environment for practice. Instead of modern gym machines, Pehlwans used traditional
                equipment
                like the Gada (mace), Mugdar (Indian clubs), and Sumtola (wooden dumbbells) to develop strength. Rope
                climbing,
                push-ups, and squats were also essential exercises. Diet played a crucial role, with wrestlers consuming
                a
                nutritious blend of milk, ghee, almonds, butter, and Ayurvedic supplements like Ashwagandha to enhance
                their
                stamina and recovery. More than just a fitness regime, Akhadas promoted a disciplined lifestyle,
                requiring
                wrestlers to wake up early, meditate, and avoid distractions like alcohol and tobacco. Although modern
                gyms with
                advanced equipment have become popular, many traditional Akhadas still exist in India, preserving this
                ancient
                fitness culture.</p>
            <p>In Gymnasiums, apparatus such as barbells, bumper plates, kettlebells, dumbbells, resistance bands,
                jumping
                boards, running paths, tennis balls, cricket fields, and fencing areas are used for exercises. Outdoor
                settings
                are healthiest when the weather is safe. Gyms were popular in ancient Greece. Their curricula included
                self-defense, gymnastics medica, or physical therapy to help the sick and injured, and for physical
                fitness and
                sports, from boxing to dancing to skipping rope.</p>
            <p>Gymnasiums also had teachers of wisdom and philosophy. Community gymnastic events were done as part of
                the
                celebrations during various village festivals. In ancient Greece there was a phrase of contempt, "He can
                neither
                swim nor write." After a while, however, Olympic athletes began training in buildings specifically
                designed for
                them.Community sports never became as popular among ancient Romans as it had among the ancient
                Greeks. Gyms
                were used more as a preparation for military service or spectator sports. During the Roman Empire, the
                gymnastic
                art was forgotten. In the Dark Ages there were sword fighting tournaments and of chivalry; and after
                gunpowder
                was invented sword fighting began to be replaced by the sport of fencing, as well as schools of dagger
                fighting
                and wrestling and boxing.</p>
            <p>In ancient Greece, the gymnasion (γυμνάσιον) was a locality for both physical and intellectual education
                of young
                men. The latter meaning of intellectual education persisted in Greek, German and other languages to
                denote a
                certain type of school providing secondary education, the gymnasium, whereas in English the meaning of
                physical
                education pertained to the word 'gym'.The Greek word gymnasion, which means "school for naked
                exercise," was
                used to designate a locality for the education of young men, including physical education (gymnastics,
                for
                example, exercise) which was customarily performed naked, as well as bathing, and studies. For the
                Greeks,
                physical education was considered as important as cognitive learning. Most Greek gymnasia had libraries
                for use
                after relaxing in the baths</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
            <p><b>History of Indian Gym Culture</b>

                India has a long and rich tradition of physical fitness, dating back thousands of years. The earliest
                form of
                structured exercise can be traced to ancient Hindu texts like the Vedas and Puranas, which emphasize
                physical
                strength, yoga, and martial arts as essential for a balanced life. Over time, this evolved into a unique
                system
                of training that gave rise to the Akhada culture, which became the foundation of Indian gyms.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Ancient Period (Before 10th Century)</b>

                The concept of fitness in ancient India was closely linked to martial arts and spiritual well-being.
                Warriors
                and kings were expected to maintain peak physical fitness, and exercises were integrated with combat
                training.
                The Mahabharata and Ramayana mention warriors like Bhima and Hanuman, who were known for their immense
                strength,
                achieved through traditional workouts. Yoga, which originated in India over 5,000 years ago, also played
                a major
                role in promoting flexibility, endurance, and inner strength.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Medieval Period (10th to 18th Century)</b>

                During the medieval period, India saw the rise of Akhadas, traditional wrestling schools that became the
                centers
                of physical training. Wrestlers, called Pehlwans, trained in these Akhadas using natural bodyweight
                exercises,
                mud wrestling, and wooden training equipment like Gada (mace) and Mugdar (clubs). The Mughals also
                influenced
                Indian fitness culture, introducing Persian-style wrestling (Koshti) and training techniques. Akhadas
                became not
                just training centers but also hubs of discipline, where wrestlers followed a strict vegetarian diet
                rich in
                milk, ghee, and almonds.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>British Colonial Period (18th to 20th Century)</b>

                During British rule, India saw a decline in traditional fitness practices as Western sports and
                gymnasiums were
                introduced. However, many freedom fighters and revolutionaries secretly practiced wrestling and physical
                fitness
                in Akhadas to maintain their strength and combat readiness. This period also saw the emergence of modern
                weightlifting and bodybuilding, inspired by Western practices but still deeply rooted in Indian
                traditions. K.D.
                Jadhav, India's first Olympic medalist in wrestling (1952), was trained in an Akhada before competing at
                the
                global level.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Modern Era (20th Century Onwards)</b>

                In the 20th century, Western-style gyms started gaining popularity in Indian cities. With the rise of
                bodybuilding icons like Manohar Aich and Premchand Degra, weight training and fitness became mainstream.
                By the
                21st century, fitness chains, commercial gyms, and modern equipment-based workouts became widely
                accepted.
                Despite this shift, many Akhadas continue to thrive in rural India, preserving the age-old traditions of
                Indian
                fitness. Today, there is a revival of interest in Indian workout techniques like club training, yoga,
                and
                natural bodyweight exercises, blending the best of old and new fitness practices.



                India's gym culture has evolved from ancient warrior training and Akhada-based wrestling to modern
                fitness
                centers with advanced equipment. While traditional fitness methods still hold cultural and functional
                value,
                modern gyms cater to a wider audience looking for structured workouts. The blend of ancient wisdom and
                contemporary fitness science continues to shape India's evolving gym culture.
            </p>
            <p>The first recorded gymnasiums date back to over 3000 years ago in ancient Persia, where they were known
                as
                zurkhaneh, areas that encouraged physical fitness. The larger Roman Baths often had attached fitness
                facilities,
                the baths themselves sometimes being decorated with mosaics of local champions of sport. Gyms in Germany
                were an
                outgrowth of the Turnplatz, an outdoor space for gymnastics founded by German educator Friedrich Jahn in
                1811
                and later promoted by the Turners, a nineteenth-century political and gymnastic movement. The first
                American to
                open a public gym in the United States using Jahn's model was John Neal of Portland, Maine in 1827. The
                first
                indoor gymnasium in Germany was probably the one built in Hesse in 1852 by Adolph Spiess.</p>
            <p>Through worldwide colonization, Great Britain expanded its national interest in sports and games to many
                countries. In the 1800s, programs were added to schools and college curricula that emphasized health,
                strength,
                and bodily measure. Sports drawn from European and British cultures thrived as college students and
                upper-class
                clubs financed competition. As a result, towns began building playgrounds that furthered interest in
                sports and
                physical activity. Early efforts to establish gyms in the United States in the 1820s were documented and
                promoted by John Neal in the American Journal of Education and The Yankee, helping to establish the
                American
                branch of the movement. Later in the century, the Turner movement was founded and continued to thrive
                into
                the early twentieth century. The first Turners group was formed in London in 1848. The Turners built
                gymnasiums
                in several cities like Cincinnati and St. Louis, which had large German American populations. These gyms
                were
                utilized by adults and youth. For example, a young Lou Gehrig would frequent the Turner gym in New York
                City
                with his father.</p>
            <p>The Boston Young Men's Christian Union claims to be "America's First Gym". The YMCA first organized in
                Boston in
                1851 and a smaller branch opened in Rangasville in 1852. Ten years later there were some two hundred
                YMCAs
                across the country, most of which provided gyms for exercise, games, and social interaction.[citation
                needed]

                The 1920s was a decade of prosperity that witnessed the building of large numbers of public high schools
                with a
                gymnasium, an idea founded by Nicolas Isaranga.[citation needed]

                Today, gymnasiums are commonplace in the United States. They are in virtually all U.S. colleges and high
                schools, as well as almost all middle schools and elementary schools. These facilities are used for
                physical
                education, intramural sports, and school gatherings. The number of gyms in the U.S. has more than
                doubled since
                the late 1980s. Today, fitness gyms and private health clubs are a huge global business.</p>
